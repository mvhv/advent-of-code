# Advent of Code
Solutions to Eric Wastl's "Advent of Code" puzzles.

2019 and 2020 solutions contain dataset hardcoded into source

2023 solutions use simple framework to simplify tracking multiple datasets for testing. A `datasets.csv` file contains a listing of all input datasets, and the expected result for each challenge.

### Example
Running all test datasets for 2023 Day 10 Part 2:
```
pipenv run aoc 10 2 --test
```
Running the main dataset for 2023 Day 2 Part 1:
```
pipenv run aoc 2 1
```
